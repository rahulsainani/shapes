# Shapes

A simple android app that draws shapes on a canvas. 

## What it does

*Editor screen*

1. There are 3 buttons (square, circle, and triangle). Each time you tap on a button: an object of that shape will be created, and displayed in a random position on screen.
2. Tapping on a shape will cause it to become another shape: tapping a square will make it a circle, tapping a circle will make it a triangle, tapping a triangle will make it a square.
3. Long pressing on a shape will remove the shape. 
4. You can undo any action. Each time you press undo it will cancel the last action performed.

*Stats screen*

1. Shows a list with the name and count of each shape.
2. Tapping on a list item will delete all shapes of that kind.
